36	1	An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked	 [Or heart	 Sin proceeds from the wicked.] There is no fear of God before his eyes. 
36	2	For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin. 
36	3	The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful he has ceased to be wise and to do good. 
36	4	Even on his bed he plots evil he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong. 
36	5	Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies. 
36	6	Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the great deep. O LORD, you preserve both man and beast. 
36	7	How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find [Or love, O God! Men find or love! Both heavenly beings and men find] refuge in the shadow of your wings. 
36	8	They feast in the abundance of your house you give them drink from your river of delights. 
36	9	For with you is the fountain of life in your light we see light. 
36	10	Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart. 
36	11	May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. 
36	12	See how the evildoers lie fallen	thrown down, not able to rise!37 OF DAVID. [THIS PSALM IS AN ACROSTIC POEM, THE STANZAS OF WHICH BEGIN WITH THE SUCCESSIVE LETTERS OF THE HEBREW ALPHABET.]
