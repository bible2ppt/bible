48	1	Great is the LORD, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, his holy mountain. 
48	2	It is beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth. Like the utmost heights of Zaphon [Zaphon can refer to a sacred mountain or the direction north.] is Mount Zion, the [Or earth, Mount Zion, on the northern side of the] city of the Great King 
48	3	God is in her citadels he has shown himself to be her fortress. 
48	4	When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together, 
48	5	they saw her and were astounded they fled in terror. 
48	6	Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labour. 
48	7	You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind. 
48	8	As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD Almighty, in the city of our God	 God makes her secure for ever. Selah 
48	9	Within your temple, O God, we meditate on your unfailing love. 
48	10	Like your name, O God, your praise reaches to the ends of the earth your right hand is filled with righteousness. 
48	11	Mount Zion rejoices, the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments. 
48	12	Walk about Zion, go round her, count her towers, 
48	13	consider well her ramparts, view her citadels, that you may tell of them to the next generation. 
48	14	For this God is our God for ever and ever he will be our guide even to the end.49 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. OF THE SONS OF KORAH. A PSALM.
