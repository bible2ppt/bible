115	1	Not to us, O LORD, not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness. 
115	2	Why do the nations say, Where is their God? 
115	3	Our God is in heaven he does whatever pleases him. 
115	4	But their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men. 
115	5	They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but they cannot see 
115	6	they have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but they cannot smell 
115	7	they have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but they cannot walk nor can they utter a sound with their throats. 
115	8	Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them. 
115	9	O house of Israel, trust in the LORD	he is their help and shield. 
115	10	house of Aaron, trust in the LORD	he is their help and shield. 
115	11	You who fear him, trust in the LORD	he is their help and shield. 
115	12	The LORD remembers us and will bless us	 He will bless the house of Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron, 
115	13	he will bless those who fear the LORD	small and great alike. 
115	14	May the LORD make you increase, both you and your children. 
115	15	May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. 
115	16	The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth he has given to man. 
115	17	It is not the dead who praise the LORD, those who go down to silence 
115	18	it is we who extol the LORD, both now and for evermore. Praise the LORD. [Hebrew	 Hallelu Yah]
