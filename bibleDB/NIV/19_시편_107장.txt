107	1	Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good his love endures for ever. 
107	2	Let the redeemed of the LORD say this	those he redeemed from the hand of the foe, 
107	3	those he gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south. [Hebrew	 north and the sea] 
107	4	Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle. 
107	5	They were hungry and thirsty, and their lives ebbed away. 
107	6	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress. 
107	7	He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle. 
107	8	Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men, 
107	9	for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things. 
107	10	Some sat in darkness and the deepest gloom, prisoners suffering in iron chains, 
107	11	for they had rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High. 
107	12	So he subjected them to bitter labour they stumbled, and there was no-one to help. 
107	13	Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress. 
107	14	He brought them out of darkness and the deepest gloom and broke away their chains. 
107	15	Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men, 
107	16	for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron. 
107	17	Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities. 
107	18	They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death. 
107	19	Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress. 
107	20	He sent forth his word and healed them he rescued them from the grave. 
107	21	Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men. 
107	22	Let them sacrifice thank-offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy. 
107	23	Others went out on the sea in ships they were merchants on the mighty waters. 
107	24	They saw the works of the LORD, his wonderful deeds in the deep. 
107	25	For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves. 
107	26	They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths in their peril their courage melted away. 
107	27	They reeled and staggered like drunken men they were at their witsâ€™ end. 
107	28	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress. 
107	29	He stilled the storm to a whisper the waves of the sea were hushed. 
107	30	They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven. 
107	31	Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men. 
107	32	Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders. 
107	33	He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground, 
107	34	and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there. 
107	35	He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs 
107	36	there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle. 
107	37	They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest 
107	38	he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish. 
107	39	Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity and sorrow 
107	40	he who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste. 
107	41	But he lifted the needy out of their affliction and increased their families like flocks. 
107	42	The upright see and rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths. 
107	43	Whoever is wise, let him heed these things and consider the great love of the LORD.108 A SONG. A PSALM OF DAVID.
