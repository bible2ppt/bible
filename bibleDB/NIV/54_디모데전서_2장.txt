2	1	I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone 
2	2	for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. 
2	3	This is good, and pleases God our Saviour, 
2	4	who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
2	5	For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 
2	6	who gave himself as a ransom for all men	the testimony given in its proper time. 
2	7	And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle	I am telling the truth, I am not lying	and a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles. 
2	8	I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing. 
2	9	I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 
2	10	but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. 
2	11	A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. 
2	12	I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man she must be silent. 
2	13	For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
2	14	And Adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 
2	15	But women [Greek	 she] will be saved [Or restored] through childbearing	if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.
