43	1	[In many Hebrew manuscripts Psalms 42 and 43 constitute one psalm.] Vindicate me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation rescue me from deceitful and wicked men. 
43	2	You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy? 
43	3	Send forth your light and your truth, let them guide me let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell. 
43	4	Then will I go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight. I will praise you with the harp, O God, my God. 
43	5	Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Saviour and my God. 129644 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. OF THE SONS OF KORAH. A MASKIL. [TITLE	 PROBABLY A LITERARY OR MUSICAL TERM]
