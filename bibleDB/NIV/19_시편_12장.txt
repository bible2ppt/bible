12	1	LORD, for the godly are no more the faithful have vanished from among men. 
12	2	Everyone lies to his neighbour their flattering lips speak with deception. 
12	3	May the LORD cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue 
12	4	that says, We will triumph with our tongues we own our lips	[Or our lips are our ploughshares] who is our master? 
12	5	Because of the oppression of the weak and the groaning of the needy, I will now arise, says the LORD. I will protect them from those who malign them. 
12	6	And the words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace of clay, purified seven times. 
12	7	LORD, you will keep us safe and protect us from such people for ever. 
12	8	The wicked freely strut about when what is vile is honoured among men.13 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. A PSALM OF DAVID.
