50	1	The Mighty One, God, the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to the place where it sets. 
50	2	From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth. 
50	3	Our God comes and will not be silent a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages. 
50	4	He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people	 
50	5	Gather to me my consecrated ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice. 
50	6	And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah 
50	7	Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you	 I am God, your God. 
50	8	I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, which are ever before me. 
50	9	I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens, 
50	10	for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills. 
50	11	I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are mine. 
50	12	If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it. 
50	13	Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? 
50	14	Sacrifice thank-offerings to God, fulfil your vows to the Most High, 
50	15	and call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver you, and you will honour me. 
50	16	But to the wicked, God says	 What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips? 
50	17	You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you. 
50	18	When you see a thief, you join with him you throw in your lot with adulterers. 
50	19	You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit. 
50	20	You speak continually against your brother and slander your own mother’s son. 
50	21	These things you have done and I kept silent you thought I was altogether [Or thought the I AM’ was] like you. But I will rebuke you and accuse you to your face. 
50	22	Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with none to rescue	 
50	23	He who sacrifices thank-offerings honours me, and he prepares the way so that I may show him [Or and to him who considers his way I will show] the salvation of God.51 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. A PSALM OF DAVID. WHEN THE PROPHET NATHAN CAME TO HIM AFTE
