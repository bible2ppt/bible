11	1	I ask then	 Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 
11	2	God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don’t you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah	how he appealed to God against Israel	 
11	3	Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me? [1 Kings 19	10,14] 
11	4	And what was God’s answer to him? I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal. [1 Kings 19	18] 
11	5	So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 
11	6	And if by grace, then it is no longer by works if it were, grace would no longer be grace. [Some manuscripts	 by grace. But if by works, then it is no longer grace if it were, work would no longer be work.] 
11	7	What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened, 
11	8	as it is written	 God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day. [Deut. 29	4 Isaiah 29	10] 
11	9	And David says	 May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling-block and a retribution for them. 
11	10	May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent for ever. [Psalm 69	22,23] 
11	11	Again I ask	 Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. 
11	12	But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fulness bring! 
11	13	I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry 
11	14	in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. 
11	15	For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 
11	16	If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy if the root is holy, so are the branches. 
11	17	If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, 
11	18	do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this	 You do not support the root, but the root supports you. 
11	19	You will say then, Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in. 
11	20	Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. 
11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. 
11	22	Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God	 sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. 
11	23	And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 
11	24	After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! 
11	25	I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited	 Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. 
11	26	And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written	 The deliverer will come from Zion he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. 
11	27	And this is [Or will be] my covenant with them when I take away their sins. [Isaiah 59	20,21 27	9 Jer. 31	33,34] 
11	28	As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, 
11	29	for God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable. 
11	30	Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, 
11	31	so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now [Some manuscripts	 do not have now.] receive mercy as a result of God’s mercy to you. 
11	32	For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. 
11	33	Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and [Or riches and the wisdom and the] knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! 
11	34	Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counsellor? [Isaiah 40	13] 
11	35	Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him? [Job 41	11] 
11	36	For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.
