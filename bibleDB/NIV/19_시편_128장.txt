128	1	Blessed are all who fear the LORD, who walk in his ways. 
128	2	You will eat the fruit of your labour blessings and prosperity will be yours. 
128	3	Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house your sons will be like olive shoots round your table. 
128	4	Thus is the man blessed who fears the LORD. 
128	5	May the LORD bless you from Zion all the days of your life may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem, 
128	6	and may you live to see your childrenâ€™s children. Peace be upon Israel.129 A SONG OF ASCENTS.
