6	1	As God’s fellow-workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. 
6	2	For he says, In the time of my favour I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you. [Isaiah 49	8] I tell you, now is the time of God’s favour, now is the day of salvation. 
6	3	We put no stumbling-block in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited. 
6	4	Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way	 in great endurance in troubles, hardships and distresses 
6	5	in beatings, imprisonments and riots in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger 
6	6	in purity, understanding, patience and kindness in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love 
6	7	in truthful speech and in the power of God with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left 
6	8	through glory and dishonour, bad report and good report genuine, yet regarded as impostors 
6	9	known, yet regarded as unknown dying, and yet we live on beaten, and yet not killed 
6	10	sorrowful, yet always rejoicing poor, yet making many rich having nothing, and yet possessing everything. 
6	11	We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you. 
6	12	We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us. 
6	13	As a fair exchange	I speak as to my children	open wide your hearts also. 
6	14	Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? 
6	15	What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? [Greek	 Beliar, a variant of Belial] What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 
6	16	What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said	 I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people. [Lev. 26	12 Jer. 32	38 Ezek. 37	27] 
6	17	Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you. [Isaiah 52	11 Ezek. 20	34,41] 
6	18	I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty. [2 Samuel 7	14 7	8]
