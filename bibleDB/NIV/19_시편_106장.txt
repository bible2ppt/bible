106	1	Praise the LORD. [Hebrew	 Hallelu Yah also in verse 48] Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good his love endures for ever. 
106	2	Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise? 
106	3	Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right. 
106	4	Remember me, O LORD, when you show favour to your people, come to my aid when you save them, 
106	5	that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise. 
106	6	We have sinned, even as our fathers did we have done wrong and acted wickedly. 
106	7	When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea. [Hebrew	 Yam Suph that is, Sea of Reeds also in verses 9 and 22] 
106	8	Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, to make his mighty power known. 
106	9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up he led them through the depths as through a desert. 
106	10	He saved them from the hand of the foe from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them. 
106	11	The waters covered their adversaries not one of them survived. 
106	12	Then they believed his promises and sang his praise. 
106	13	But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel. 
106	14	In the desert they gave in to their craving in the wasteland they put God to the test. 
106	15	So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them. 
106	16	In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD. 
106	17	The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan it buried the company of Abiram. 
106	18	Fire blazed among their followers a flame consumed the wicked. 
106	19	At Horeb they made a calf and worshipped an idol cast from metal. 
106	20	They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass. 
106	21	They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt, 
106	22	miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. 
106	23	So he said he would destroy them	had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them. 
106	24	Then they despised the pleasant land they did not believe his promise. 
106	25	They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD. 
106	26	So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert, 
106	27	make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands. 
106	28	They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods 
106	29	they provoked the LORD to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them. 
106	30	But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked. 
106	31	This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come. 
106	32	By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them 
106	33	for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses’ lips. [Or against his spirit, and rash words came from his lips] 
106	34	They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them, 
106	35	but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs. 
106	36	They worshipped their idols, which became a snare to them. 
106	37	They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. 
106	38	They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood. 
106	39	They defiled themselves by what they did by their deeds they prostituted themselves. 
106	40	Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance. 
106	41	He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them. 
106	42	Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power. 
106	43	Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin. 
106	44	But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry 
106	45	for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented. 
106	46	He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive. 
106	47	Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise. 
106	48	Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, Amen! Praise the LORD.
