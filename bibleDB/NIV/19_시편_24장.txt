24	4	He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear by what is false. [Or swear falsely] 
24	5	He will receive blessing from the LORD and vindication from God his Saviour. 
24	6	Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, O God of Jacob. [Two Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac (see also Septuagint) most Hebrew manuscripts face, Jacob] Selah 
24	7	Lift up your heads, O you gates be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. 
24	8	Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. 
24	9	Lift up your heads, O you gates lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. 
24	10	Who is he, this King of glory? The LORD Almighty	he is the King of glory. Selah 127125 OF DAVID. [THIS PSALM IS AN ACROSTIC POEM, THE VERSES OF WHICH BEGIN WITH THE SUCCESSIVE LETTERS OF THE HEBREW ALPHABET.]
