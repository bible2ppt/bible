1	1	The words of the Teacher, [Or leader of the assembly also in verses 2 and 12] son of David, king of Jerusalem	 
1	2	Meaningless! Meaningless! says the Teacher. Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless. 
1	3	What does man gain from all his labour at which he toils under the sun? 
1	4	Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains for ever. 
1	5	The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises. 
1	6	The wind blows to the south and turns to the north round and round it goes, ever returning on its course. 
1	7	All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again. 
1	8	All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing. 
1	9	What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again there is nothing new under the sun. 
1	10	Is there anything of which one can say, Look! This is something new? It was here already, long ago it was here before our time. 
1	11	There is no remembrance of men of old, and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow. 
1	12	I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
1	13	I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men! 
1	14	I have seen all the things that are done under the sun all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 
1	15	What is twisted cannot be straightened what is lacking cannot be counted. 
1	16	I thought to myself, Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge. 
1	17	Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind. 
1	18	For with much wisdom comes much sorrow the more knowledge, the more grief.
