11	1	In the LORD I take refuge. How then can you say to me	 Flee like a bird to your mountain. 
11	2	For look, the wicked bend their bows they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart. 
11	3	When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do? [Or what is the Righteous One doing] 
11	4	The LORD is in his holy temple the LORD is on his heavenly throne. He observes the sons of men his eyes examine them. 
11	5	The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked [Or The LORD, the Righteous One, examines the wicked,] and those who love violence his soul hates. 
11	6	On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulphur a scorching wind will be their lot. 
11	7	For the LORD is righteous, he loves justice upright men will see his face.12 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. ACCORDING TO SHEMINITH. [TITLE	 PROBABLY A MUSICAL TERM] A PSALM OF DAVID.
