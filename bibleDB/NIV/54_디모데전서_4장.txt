4	1	The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. 
4	2	Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. 
4	3	They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. 
4	4	For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 
4	5	because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer. 
4	6	If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed. 
4	7	Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales rather, train yourself to be godly. 
4	8	For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. 
4	9	This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance 
4	10	(and for this we labour and strive), that we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, and especially of those who believe. 
4	11	Command and teach these things. 
4	12	Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity. 
4	13	Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. 
4	14	Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you. 
4	15	Be diligent in these matters give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. 
4	16	Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
