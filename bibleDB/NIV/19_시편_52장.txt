52	1	Why do you boast of evil, you mighty man? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God? 
52	2	Your tongue plots destruction it is like a sharpened razor, you who practise deceit. 
52	3	You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth. Selah 
52	4	You love every harmful word, O you deceitful tongue! 
52	5	Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin	 He will snatch you up and tear you from your tent he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah 
52	6	The righteous will see and fear they will laugh at him, saying, 
52	7	Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others! 
52	8	But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God I trust in God’s unfailing love for ever and ever. 
52	9	I will praise you for ever for what you have done in your name I will hope, for your name is good. I will praise you in the presence of your saints.53 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A MASKIL [TITLE	 PROBABLY A LITERARY OR MUSICAL
