149	1	Praise the LORD. [Hebrew	 Hallelu Yah also in verse 9] Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of the saints. 
149	2	Let Israel rejoice in their Maker let the people of Zion be glad in their King. 
149	3	Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with tambourine and harp. 
149	4	For the LORD takes delight in his people he crowns the humble with salvation. 
149	5	Let the saints rejoice in this honour and sing for joy on their beds. 
149	6	May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, 
149	7	to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, 
149	8	to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, 
149	9	to carry out the sentence written against them. This is the glory of all his saints. Praise the LORD.
