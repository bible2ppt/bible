90	1	Lord, you have been our dwelling-place throughout all generations. 
90	2	Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. 
90	3	You turn men back to dust, saying, Return to dust, O sons of men. 
90	4	For a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night. 
90	5	You sweep men away in the sleep of death they are like the new grass of the morning 
90	6	though in the morning it springs up new, by evening it is dry and withered. 
90	7	We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation. 
90	8	You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. 
90	9	All our days pass away under your wrath we finish our years with a moan. 
90	10	The length of our days is seventy years	or eighty, if we have the strength yet their span [Or yet the best of them] is but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away. 
90	11	Who knows the power of your anger? For your wrath is as great as the fear that is due to you. 
90	12	Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. 
90	13	Relent, O LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants. 
90	14	Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. 
90	15	Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble. 
90	16	May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendour to their children. 
90	17	May the favour [Or beauty] of the Lord our God rest upon us establish the work of our hands for us	yes, establish the work of our hands.
