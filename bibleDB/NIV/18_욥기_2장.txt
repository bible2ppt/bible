2	2	And the LORD said to Satan, Where have you come from? Satan answered the LORD, From roaming through the earth and going to and fro in it. 
2	3	Then the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job? There is no-one on earth like him he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him witho 
2	4	Skin for skin! Satan replied. A man will give all he has for his own life. 
2	5	But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.

2	9	His wife said to him, Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!

2	13	Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No-one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.
