5	1	Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us look, and see our disgrace. 
5	2	Our inheritance has been turned over to aliens, our homes to foreigners. 
5	3	We have become orphans and fatherless, our mothers like widows. 
5	4	We must buy the water we drink our wood can be had only at a price. 
5	5	Those who pursue us are at our heels we are weary and find no rest. 
5	6	We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread. 
5	7	Our fathers sinned and are no more, and we bear their punishment. 
5	8	Slaves rule over us, and there is none to free us from their hands. 
5	9	We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the desert. 
5	10	Our skin is hot as an oven, feverish from hunger. 
5	11	Women have been ravished in Zion, and virgins in the towns of Judah. 
5	12	Princes have been hung up by their hands elders are shown no respect. 
5	13	Young men toil at the millstones boys stagger under loads of wood. 
5	14	The elders are gone from the city gate the young men have stopped their music. 
5	15	Joy is gone from our hearts our dancing has turned to mourning. 
5	16	The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned! 
5	17	Because of this our hearts are faint because of these things our eyes grow dim 
5	18	for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, with jackals prowling over it. 
5	19	You, O LORD, reign for ever your throne endures from generation to generation. 
5	20	Why do you always forget us? Why do you forsake us so long? 
5	21	Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may return renew our days as of old 
5	22	unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure. 1795 EZEKIEL
