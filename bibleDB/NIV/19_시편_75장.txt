75	1	We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks, for your Name is near men tell of your wonderful deeds. 
75	2	You say, I choose the appointed time it is I who judge uprightly. 
75	3	When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm. Selah 
75	4	To the arrogant I say, `Boast no more,’ and to the wicked, `Do not lift up your horns. 
75	5	Do not lift your horns against heaven do not speak with outstretched neck.’ 
75	6	No-one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt a man. 
75	7	But it is God who judges	 He brings one down, he exalts another. 
75	8	In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs. 
75	9	As for me, I will declare this for ever I will sing praise to the God of Jacob. 
75	10	I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.76 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A PSALM OF ASAPH. A SONG.
