2	1	This is what the LORD says	 For three sins of Moab, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because he burned, as if to lime, the bones of Edomâ€™s king, 
2	2	I will send fire upon Moab that will consume the fortresses of Kerioth. [Or of her cities] Moab will go down in great tumult amid war cries and the blast of the trumpet. 
2	3	I will destroy her ruler and kill all her officials with him, says the LORD. 
2	4	This is what the LORD says	 For three sins of Judah, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because they have rejected the law of the LORD and have not kept his decrees, because they have been led astray by false gods, [Or by lies] the gods [Or l
