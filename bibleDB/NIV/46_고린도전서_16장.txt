16	1	Now about the collection for Godâ€™s people	 Do what I told the Galatian churches to do. 
16	2	On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made. 
16	3	Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem. 
16	4	If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me. 
16	5	After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you	for I will be going through Macedonia. 
16	6	Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go. 
16	7	I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. 
16	8	But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost, 
16	9	because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me. 
16	10	If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I1Co. 
16	11	No-one, then, should refuse to accept him. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers. 
16	12	Now about our brother Apollos	 I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity. 
16	13	Be on your guard stand firm in the faith be men of courage be strong. 
16	14	Do everything in love. 
16	15	You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. I urge you, brothers, 
16	16	to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work, and labours at it. 
16	17	I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you. 
16	18	For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition. 
16	19	The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla [Greek	 Prisca, a variant of Priscilla] greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house. 
16	20	All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
16	21	I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. 
16	22	If anyone does not love the Lord	a curse be on him. Come, O Lord! [In Aramaic the expression Come, O Lord is Marana tha.] 
16	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 
16	24	My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen. [Some manuscripts	 do not have Amen.] 457 2 CORINTHIANS
