57	2	I cry out to God Most High, to God, who fulfils his purpose for me. 
57	3	He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me Selah God sends his love and his faithfulness. 
57	4	I am in the midst of lions I lie among ravenous beasts	men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords. 
57	5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens let your glory be over all the earth. 
57	6	They spread a net for my feet	I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path	but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah 
57	7	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast I will sing and make music. 
57	8	Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. 
57	9	I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations I will sing of you among the peoples. 
57	10	For great is your love, reaching to the heavens your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
