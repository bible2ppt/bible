6	1	O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath. 
6	2	Be merciful to me, LORD, for I am faint O LORD, heal me, for my bones are in agony. 
6	3	My soul is in anguish. How long, O LORD, how long? 
6	4	Turn, O LORD, and deliver me save me because of your unfailing love. 
6	5	No-one remembers you when he is dead. Who praises you from his grave? [Hebrew	 Sheol] 
6	6	I am worn out from groaning all night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears. 
6	7	My eyes grow weak with sorrow they fail because of all my foes. 
6	8	Away from me, all you who do evil, for the LORD has heard my weeping. 
6	9	The LORD has heard my cry for mercy the LORD accepts my prayer. 
6	10	All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed they will turn back in sudden disgrace. 12507 A SHIGGAION [TITLE	 PROBABLY A LITERARY OR MUSICAL TERM] OF DAVID, WHICH HE SANG TO THE LORD CONCERNING CUSH, A BENJAMITE.
