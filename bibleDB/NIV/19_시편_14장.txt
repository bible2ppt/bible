14	1	The fool [The Hebrew words rendered fool in Psalms denote one who is morally deficient.] says in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, their deeds are vile there is no-one who does good. 
14	2	The LORD looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God. 
14	3	All have turned aside, they have together become corrupt there is no-one who does good, not even one. 
14	4	Will evildoers never learn	those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on the LORD? 
14	5	There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous. 
14	6	You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge. 
14	7	Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!15 A PSALM OF DAVID.
