114	1	When Israel came out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue, 
114	2	Judah became Godâ€™s sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 
114	3	The sea looked and fled, the Jordan turned back 
114	4	the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. 
114	5	Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back, 
114	6	you mountains, that you skipped like rams, you hills, like lambs? 
114	7	Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 
114	8	who turned the rock into a pool, the hard rock into springs of water.
