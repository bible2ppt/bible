66	1	Shout with joy to God, all the earth! 
66	2	Sing the glory of his name make his praise glorious! 
66	3	Say to God, How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you. 
66	4	All the earth bows down to you they sing praise to you, they sing praise to your name. Selah 
66	5	Come and see what God has done, how awesome his works on manâ€™s behalf! 
66	6	He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot	come, let us rejoice in him. 
66	7	He rules for ever by his power, his eyes watch the nations	let not the rebellious rise up against him. Selah 
66	8	Praise our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard 
66	9	he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping. 
66	10	For you, O God, tested us you refined us like silver. 
66	11	You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs. 
66	12	You let men ride over our heads we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance. 
66	13	I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfil my vows to you 
66	14	vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble. 
66	15	I will sacrifice fat animals to you and an offering of rams I will offer bulls and goats. Selah 
66	16	Come and listen, all you who fear God let me tell you what he has done for me. 
66	17	I cried out to him with my mouth his praise was on my tongue. 
66	18	If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened 
66	19	but God has surely listened and heard my voice in prayer. 
66	20	Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me! 132267 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A PSALM. A SONG.
