80	1	Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock you who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth 
80	2	before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might come and save us. 
80	3	Restore us, O God make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved. 
80	4	LORD God Almighty, how long will your anger smoulder against the prayers of your people? 
80	5	You have fed them with the bread of tears you have made them drink tears by the bowlful. 
80	6	You have made us a source of contention to our neighbours, and our enemies mock us. 
80	7	Restore us, O God Almighty make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved. 
80	8	You brought a vine out of Egypt you drove out the nations and planted it. 
80	9	You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land. 
80	10	The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches. 
80	11	It sent out its boughs to the Sea, [Probably the Mediterranean] its shoots as far as the River. [That is, the Euphrates] 
80	12	Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes? 
80	13	Boars from the forest ravage it and the creatures of the field feed on it. 
80	14	Return to us, O God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine, 
80	15	the root your right hand has planted, the son [Or branch] you have raised up for yourself. 
80	16	Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire at your rebuke your people perish. 
80	17	Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself. 
80	18	Then we will not turn away from you revive us, and we will call on your name. 
80	19	Restore us, O LORD God Almighty make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved. 134681 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. ACCORDING TO GITTITH. [TITLE	 PROBABLY A MUSICAL TERM] OF ASAPH.
