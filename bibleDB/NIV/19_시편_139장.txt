139	1	O LORD, you have searched me and you know me. 
139	2	You know when I sit and when I rise you perceive my thoughts from afar. 
139	3	You discern my going out and my lying down you are familiar with all my ways. 
139	4	Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely, O LORD. 
139	5	You hem me in	behind and before you have laid your hand upon me. 
139	6	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain. 
139	7	Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? 
139	8	If I go up to the heavens, you are there if I make my bed in the depths, [Hebrew	 Sheol] you are there. 
139	9	If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, 
139	10	even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast. 
139	11	If I say, Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me, 
139	12	even the darkness will not be dark to you the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you. 
139	13	For you created my inmost being you knit me together in my motherâ€™s womb. 
139	14	I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful, I know that full well. 
139	15	My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, 
139	16	your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be. 
139	17	How precious to [Or concerning] me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them! 
139	18	Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. When I awake, I am still with you. 
139	19	If only you would slay the wicked, O God! Away from me, you bloodthirsty men! 
139	20	They speak of you with evil intent your adversaries misuse your name. 
139	21	Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD, and abhor those who rise up against you? 
139	22	I have nothing but hatred for them I count them my enemies. 
139	23	Search me, O God, and know my heart test me and know my anxious thoughts. 
139	24	See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.140 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. A PSALM OF DAVID.
