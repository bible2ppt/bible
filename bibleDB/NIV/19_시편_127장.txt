127	1	Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labour in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain. 
127	2	In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat	for he grants sleep to [Or eat	for while they sleep he provides for] those he loves. 
127	3	Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward from him. 
127	4	Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in oneâ€™s youth. 
127	5	Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.128 A SONG OF ASCENTS.
