120	1	I call on the LORD in my distress, and he answers me. 
120	2	Save me, O LORD, from lying lips and from deceitful tongues. 
120	3	What will he do to you, and what more besides, O deceitful tongue? 
120	4	He will punish you with a warriorâ€™s sharp arrows, with burning coals of the broom tree. 
120	5	Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar! 
120	6	Too long have I lived among those who hate peace. 
120	7	I am a man of peace but when I speak, they are for war.121 A SONG OF ASCENTS.
