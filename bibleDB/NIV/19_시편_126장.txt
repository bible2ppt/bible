126	1	When the LORD brought back the captives to [Or LORD restored the fortunes of] Zion, we were like men who dreamed. [Or men restored to health] 
126	2	Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, The LORD has done great things for them. 
126	3	The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy. 
126	4	Restore our fortunes, [Or Bring back our captives] O LORD, like streams in the Negev. 
126	5	Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy. 
126	6	He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him.127 A SONG OF ASCENTS. OF SOLOMON.
