142	1	I cry aloud to the LORD I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy. 
142	2	I pour out my complaint before him before him I tell my trouble. 
142	3	When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who know my way. In the path where I walk men have hidden a snare for me. 
142	4	Look to my right and see no-one is concerned for me. I have no refuge no-one cares for my life. 
142	5	I cry to you, O LORD I say, You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living. 
142	6	Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. 
142	7	Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.143 A PSALM OF DAVID.
