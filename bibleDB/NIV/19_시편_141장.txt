141	1	O LORD, I call to you come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to you. 
141	2	May my prayer be set before you like incense may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice. 
141	3	Set a guard over my mouth, O LORD keep watch over the door of my lips. 
141	4	Let not my heart be drawn to what is evil, to take part in wicked deeds with men who are evildoers let me not eat of their delicacies. 
141	5	Let a righteous man [Or Let the Righteous One] strike me	it is a kindness let him rebuke me	it is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it. Yet my prayer is ever against the deeds of evildoers 
141	6	their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken. 
141	7	They will say, As one ploughs and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave. [Hebrew	 Sheol] 
141	8	But my eyes are fixed on you, O Sovereign LORD in you I take refuge	do not give me over to death. 
141	9	Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, from the traps set by evildoers. 
141	10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.142 A MASKIL [TITLE	 PROBABLY A LITERARY OR MUSICAL TERM] [TITLE	 PROBABLY A LITERARY OR MUSICAL TERM] OF DAVID. WHEN HE WAS IN THE CAVE. A PRAYER.
