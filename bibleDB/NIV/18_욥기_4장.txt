4	1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied	 
4	2	If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking? 
4	3	Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands. 
4	4	Your words have supported those who stumbled you have strengthened faltering knees. 
4	5	But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged it strikes you, and you are dismayed. 
4	6	Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope? 
4	7	Consider now	 Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed? 
4	8	As I have observed, those who plough evil and those who sow trouble reap it. 
4	9	At the breath of God they are destroyed at the blast of his anger they perish. 
4	10	The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken. 
4	11	The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.	
4	12	A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it. 
4	13	Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men, 
4	14	fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake. 
4	15	A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end. 
4	16	It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice	 
4	17	`Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker? 
4	18	If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error, 
4	19	how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth! 
4	20	Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces unnoticed, they perish for ever. 
4	21	Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?â€™ [Some interpreters end the quotation after verse 17.]
