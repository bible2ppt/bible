46	1	God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 
46	2	Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 
46	3	though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. Selah 
46	4	There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 
46	5	God is within her, she will not fall God will help her at break of day. 
46	6	Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall he lifts his voice, the earth melts. 
46	7	The LORD Almighty is with us the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah 
46	8	Come and see the works of the LORD, the desolations he has brought on the earth. 
46	9	He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth he breaks the bow and shatters the spear, he burns the shields [Or chariots] with fire. 
46	10	Be still, and know that I am God I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. 
46	11	The LORD Almighty is with us the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah47 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. OF THE SONS OF KORAH. A PSALM.
