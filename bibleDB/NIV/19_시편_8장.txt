8	1	O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens. 
8	2	From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise [Or strength] because of your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger. 
8	3	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, 
8	4	what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him? 
8	5	You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings [Or than God] and crowned him with glory and honour. 
8	6	You made him ruler over the works of your hands you put everything under his feet	 
8	7	all flocks and herds, and the beasts of the field, 
8	8	the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.
