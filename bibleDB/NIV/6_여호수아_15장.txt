15	13	In accordance with the LORD’s command to him, Joshua gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion in Judah	Kiriath Arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.) 
15	14	From Hebron Caleb drove out the three Anakites	Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai	descendants of Anak. 
15	15	From there he marched against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher). 
15	16	And Caleb said, I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher. 
15	17	Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, took it so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage. 
15	18	One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, What can I do for you? 
15	19	She replied, Do me a special favour. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water. So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
