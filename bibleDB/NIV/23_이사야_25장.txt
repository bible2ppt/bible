25	1	O LORD, you are my God I will exalt you and praise your name, for in perfect faithfulness you have done marvellous things, things planned long ago. 
25	2	You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin, the foreignersâ€™ stronghold a city no more it will never be rebuilt. 
25	3	Therefore strong peoples will honour you cities of ruthless nations will revere you. 
25	4	You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm driving against a wall 
25	5	and like the heat of the desert. You silence the uproar of foreigners as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is stilled. 
25	6	On this mountain the LORD Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine	the best of meats and the finest of wines. 
25	7	On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations 
25	8	he will swallow up death for ever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from all faces he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth. The LORD has spoken. 
25	9	In that day they will say, Surely this is our God we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the LORD, we trusted in him let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation. 
25	10	The hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain but Moab will be trampled under him as straw is trampled down in the manure. 
25	11	They will spread out their hands in it, as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim. God will bring down their pride despite the cleverness [The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.] of their hands. 
25	12	He will bring down your high fortified walls and lay them low he will bring them down to the ground, to the very dust.
