3	1	O LORD, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me! 
3	2	Many are saying of me, God will not deliver him. Selah [A word of uncertain meaning, occurring frequently in the Psalms possibly a musical term] 
3	3	But you are a shield around me, O LORD you bestow glory on me and lift [Or LORD, my Glorious One, who lifts] up my head. 
3	4	To the LORD I cry aloud, and he answers me from his holy hill. Selah 
3	5	I lie down and sleep I wake again, because the LORD sustains me. 
3	6	I will not fear the tens of thousands drawn up against me on every side. 
3	7	Arise, O LORD! Deliver me, O my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw break the teeth of the wicked. 
3	8	From the LORD comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people. Selah4 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A PSALM OF DAVID.
