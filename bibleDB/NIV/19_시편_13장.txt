13	1	How long, O LORD? Will you forget me for ever? How long will you hide your face from me? 
13	2	How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and every day have sorrow in my heart? How long will my enemy triumph over me? 
13	3	Look on me and answer, O LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death 
13	4	my enemy will say, I have overcome him, and my foes will rejoice when I fall. 
13	5	But I trust in your unfailing love my heart rejoices in your salvation. 
13	6	I will sing to the LORD, for he has been good to me. 125714 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. OF DAVID.
