47	1	Clap your hands, all you nations shout to God with cries of joy. 
47	2	How awesome is the LORD Most High, the great King over all the earth! 
47	3	He subdued nations under us, peoples under our feet. 
47	4	He chose our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom he loved. Selah 
47	5	God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the LORD amid the sounding of trumpets. 
47	6	Sing praises to God, sing praises sing praises to our King, sing praises. 
47	7	For God is the King of all the earth sing to him a psalm [Or a maskil (probably a literary or musical term)] of praise. 
47	8	God reigns over the nations God is seated on his holy throne.
