95	1	Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation. 
95	2	Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song. 
95	3	For the LORD is the great God, the great King above all gods. 
95	4	In his hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to him. 
95	5	The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land. 
95	6	Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker 
95	7	for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care. Today, if you hear his voice, 
95	8	do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, [Meribah means quarrelling.] as you did that day at Massah [Massah means testing.] in the desert, 
95	9	where your fathers tested and tried me, though they had seen what I did. 
95	10	For forty years I was angry with that generation I said, They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways. 
95	11	So I declared on oath in my anger, They shall never enter my rest.
