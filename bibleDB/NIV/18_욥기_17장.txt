17	2	Surely mockers surround me my eyes must dwell on their hostility.	
17	3	Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me? 
17	4	You have closed their minds to understanding therefore you will not let them triumph. 
17	5	If a man denounces his friends for reward, the eyes of his children will fail.

17	7	My eyes have grown dim with grief my whole frame is but a shadow. 
17	8	Upright men are appalled at this the innocent are aroused against the ungodly. 
17	9	Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger. 
17	10	But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you.

17	16	Will it go down to the gates of death? [Hebrew to Sheol] Will we descend together into the dust?
