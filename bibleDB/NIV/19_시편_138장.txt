138	1	I will praise you, O LORD, with all my heart before the gods I will sing your praise. 
138	2	I will bow down towards your holy temple and will praise your name for your love and your faithfulness, for you have exalted above all things your name and your word. 
138	3	When I called, you answered me you made me bold and stout-hearted. 
138	4	May all the kings of the earth praise you, O LORD, when they hear the words of your mouth. 
138	5	May they sing of the ways of the LORD, for the glory of the LORD is great. 
138	6	Though the LORD is on high, he looks upon the lowly, but the proud he knows from afar. 
138	7	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life you stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes, with your right hand you save me. 
138	8	The LORD will fulfil his purpose for me your love, O LORD, endures for ever	do not abandon the works of your hands. 1420139 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. OF DAVID. A PSALM.
