73	2	But as for me, my feet had almost slipped I had nearly lost my foothold. 
73	3	For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
73	4	They have no struggles their bodies are healthy and strong. [With a different word division of the Hebrew Masoretic Text struggles at their death their bodies are healthy] 
73	5	They are free from the burdens common to man they are not plagued by human ills. 
73	6	Therefore pride is their necklace they clothe themselves with violence. 
73	7	From their callous hearts comes iniquity [Syriac (see also Septuagint) Hebrew Their eyes bulge with fat] the evil conceits of their minds know no limits. 
73	8	They scoff, and speak with malice in their arrogance they threaten oppression. 
73	9	Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth. 
73	10	Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance. [The meaning of the Hebrew for this verse is uncertain.] 
73	11	They say, How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge? 
73	12	This is what the wicked are like	always carefree, they increase in wealth. 
73	13	Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure in vain have I washed my hands in innocence. 
73	14	All day long I have been plagued I have been punished every morning. 
73	15	If I had said, I will speak thus, I would have betrayed your children. 
73	16	When I tried to understand all this, it was oppressive to me

73	18	Surely you place them on slippery ground you cast them down to ruin. 
73	19	How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors! 
73	20	As a dream when one awakes, so when you arise, O Lord, you will despise them as fantasies. 
73	21	When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered, 
73	22	I was senseless and ignorant I was a brute beast before you. 
73	23	Yet I am always with you you hold me by my right hand. 
73	24	You guide me with your counsel, and afterwards you will take me into glory. 
73	25	Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you. 
73	26	My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever. 
73	27	Those who are far from you will perish you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
