22	1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from the words of my groaning? 
22	2	my God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, and am not silent. 
22	3	Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One you are the praise of Israel. [Or Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel] 
22	4	In you our fathers put their trust they trusted and you delivered them. 
22	5	They cried to you and were saved in you they trusted and were not disappointed. 
22	6	But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people. 
22	7	All who see me mock me they hurl insults, shaking their heads	 
22	8	He trusts in the LORD let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him. 
22	9	Yet you brought me out of the womb you made me trust in you even at my mother’s breast. 
22	10	From birth I was cast upon you from my mother’s womb you have been my God. 
22	11	Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no-one to help. 
22	12	Many bulls surround me strong bulls of Bashan encircle me. 
22	13	Roaring lions tearing their prey open their mouths wide against me. 
22	14	I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax it has melted away within me. 
22	15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth you lay me [Or I am laid] in the dust of death. 
22	16	Dogs have surrounded me a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced [Some Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint and Syriac most Hebrew manuscripts like the lion,] my hands and my feet. 
22	17	I can count all my bones people stare and gloat over me. 
22	18	They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing. 
22	19	But you, O LORD, be not far off O my Strength, come quickly to help me. 
22	20	Deliver my life from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs. 
22	21	Rescue me from the mouth of the lions save [Or you have heard] me from the horns of the wild oxen. 
22	22	I will declare your name to my brothers in the congregation I will praise you. 
22	23	You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honour him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel! 
22	24	For he has not despised or disdained the suffering of the afflicted one he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help. 
22	25	From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly before those who fear you [Hebrew	 him] will I fulfil my vows. 
22	26	The poor will eat and be satisfied they who seek the LORD will praise him	may your hearts live for ever! 
22	27	All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him, 
22	28	for dominion belongs to the LORD and he rules over the nations. 
22	29	All the rich of the earth will feast and worship all who go down to the dust will kneel before him	those who cannot keep themselves alive. 
22	30	Posterity will serve him future generations will be told about the Lord. 
22	31	They will proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn	for he has done it.23 A PSALM OF DAVID.
