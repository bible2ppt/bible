71	1	In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge let me never be put to shame. 
71	2	Rescue me and deliver me in your righteousness turn your ear to me and save me. 
71	3	Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress. 
71	4	Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of evil and cruel men. 
71	5	For you have been my hope, O Sovereign LORD, my confidence since my youth. 
71	6	From my birth I have relied on you you brought me forth from my motherâ€™s womb. I will ever praise you. 
71	7	I have become like a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge. 
71	8	My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendour all day long. 
71	9	Do not cast me away when I am old do not forsake me when my strength is gone. 
71	10	For my enemies speak against me those who wait to kill me conspire together. 
71	11	They say, God has forsaken him pursue him and seize him, for no-one will rescue him. 
71	12	Be not far from me, O God come quickly, O my God, to help me. 
71	13	May my accusers perish in shame may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace. 
71	14	But as for me, I shall always have hope I will praise you more and more. 
71	15	My mouth will tell of your righteousness, of your salvation all day long, though I know not its measure. 
71	16	I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, O Sovereign LORD I will proclaim your righteousness, yours alone. 
71	17	Since my youth, O God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvellous deeds. 
71	18	Even when I am old and grey, do not forsake me, O God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come. 
71	19	Your righteousness reaches to the skies, O God, you who have done great things. Who, O God, is like you? 
71	20	Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up. 
71	21	You will increase my honour and comfort me once again. 
71	22	I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God I will sing praise to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel. 
71	23	My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you	I, whom you have redeemed. 
71	24	My tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long, for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion.72 OF SOLOMON.
