33	1	But now, Job, listen to my words pay attention to everything I say. 
33	2	I am about to open my mouth my words are on the tip of my tongue. 
33	3	My words come from an upright heart my lips sincerely speak what I know. 
33	4	The Spirit of God has made me the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 
33	5	Answer me then, if you can prepare yourself and confront me. 
33	6	I am just like you before God I too have been taken from clay. 
33	7	No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you. 
33	8	But you have said in my hearing	I heard the very words 
33	9	`I am pure and without sin I am clean and free from guilt. 
33	10	Yet God has found fault with me he considers me his enemy.	
33	11	He fastens my feet in shackles he keeps close watch on all my paths.’ 
33	12	But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man. 
33	13	Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man’s words? [Or that he does not answer for any of his actions] 
33	14	For God does speak	now one way, now another	though man may not perceive it. 
33	15	In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds, 
33	16	he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings, 
33	17	to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride, 
33	18	to preserve his soul from the pit, [Or preserve him from the grave] his life from perishing by the sword. [Or from crossing the River] 
33	19	Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones, 
33	20	so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal. 
33	21	His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out. 
33	22	His soul draws near to the pit, [Or He draws near to the grave] and his life to the messengers of death. [Or to the dead] 
33	23	Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him, 
33	24	to be gracious to him and say, `Spare him from going down to the pit [Or grave] I have found a ransom for him’ 
33	25	then his flesh is renewed like a child’s it is restored as in the days of his youth.	
33	26	He prays to God and finds favour with him, he sees God’s face and shouts for joy he is restored by God to his righteous state. 
33	27	Then he comes to men and says, `I have sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved. 
33	28	He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, [Or redeemed me from going down to the grave] and I shall live to enjoy the light.’ 
33	29	God does all these things to a man	twice, even three times 
33	30	to turn back his soul from the pit, [Or turn him back from the grave] that the light of life may shine on him. 
33	31	Pay attention, Job, and listen to me be silent, and I will speak. 
33	32	If you have anything to say, answer me speak up, for I want you to be cleared. 
33	33	But if not, then listen to me be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.
