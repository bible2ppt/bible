2	1	Why do the nations conspire [Hebrew Septuagint	 rage] and the peoples plot in vain? 
2	2	The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against his Anointed One. [Or anointed one] 
2	3	Let us break their chains, they say, and throw off their fetters. 
2	4	The One enthroned in heaven laughs the Lord scoffs at them. 
2	5	Then he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying, 
2	6	I have installed my King [Or king] on Zion, my holy hill. 
2	7	I will proclaim the decree of the LORD	 He said to me, You are my Son [Or son also in verse 12] today I have become your Father. [Or have begotten you] 
2	8	Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. 
2	9	You will rule them with an iron sceptre [Or will break them with a rod of iron] you will dash them to pieces like pottery. 
2	10	Therefore, you kings, be wise be warned, you rulers of the earth. 
2	11	Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling. 
2	12	Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.3 A PSALM OF DAVID. WHEN HE FLED FROM HIS SON ABSALOM.
