37	1	At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place. 
37	2	Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth. 
37	3	He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth. 
37	4	After that comes the sound of his roar he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back. 
37	5	God’s voice thunders in marvellous ways he does great things beyond our understanding. 
37	6	He says to the snow, `Fall on the earth,’ and to the rain shower, `Be a mighty downpour.’	
37	7	So that all men he has made may know his work, he stops every man from his labour. [Or he fills all men with fear by his power] 
37	8	The animals take cover they remain in their dens. 
37	9	The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds. 
37	10	The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen. 
37	11	He loads the clouds with moisture he scatters his lightning through them. 
37	12	At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them. 
37	13	He brings the clouds to punish men, or to water his earth [Or to favour them] and show his love. 
37	14	Listen to this, Job stop and consider God’s wonders. 
37	15	Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash? 
37	16	Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge? 
37	17	You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind, 
37	18	can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze? 
37	19	Tell us what we should say to him we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness. 
37	20	Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up? 
37	21	Now no-one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean. 
37	22	Out of the north he comes in golden splendour God comes in awesome majesty.	
37	23	The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress. 
37	24	Therefore, men revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart? [Or for he does not have regard for any who think they are wise.]
