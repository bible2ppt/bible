30	1	I will exalt you, O LORD, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me. 
30	2	LORD my God, I called to you for help and you healed me. 
30	3	LORD, you brought me up from the grave [Hebrew	 Sheol] you spared me from going down into the pit. 
30	4	Sing to the LORD, you saints of his praise his holy name. 
30	5	For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favour lasts a lifetime weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning. 
30	6	When I felt secure, I said, I shall never be shaken. 
30	7	LORD, when you favoured me, you made my mountain [Or hill country] stand firm but when you hid your face, I was dismayed. 
30	8	To you, O LORD, I called to the Lord I cried for mercy	 
30	9	What gain is there in my destruction, [Or there if I am silenced] in my going down into the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness? 
30	10	Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me O LORD, be my help. 
30	11	You turned my wailing into dancing you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, 
30	12	that my heart may sing to you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give you thanks for ever.31 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. A PSALM OF DAVID.
