13	1	If I speak in the tongues [Or languages] of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 
13	2	If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 
13	3	If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, [Some early manuscripts body that I may boast] but have not love, I gain nothing. 
13	4	Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
13	5	It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 
13	6	Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
13	7	It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 
13	8	Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease where there are tongues, they will be stilled where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
13	9	For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
13	10	but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 
13	11	When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 
13	12	Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. 
13	13	And now these three remain	 faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
