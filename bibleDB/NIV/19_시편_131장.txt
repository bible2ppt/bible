131	1	My heart is not proud, O LORD, my eyes are not haughty I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me. 
131	2	But I have stilled and quietened my soul like a weaned child with its mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me. 
131	3	Israel, put your hope in the LORD both now and for evermore.132 A SONG OF ASCENTS.
