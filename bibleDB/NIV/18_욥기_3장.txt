3	1	After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. 
3	2	He said	 
3	3	May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, `A boy is born!’ 
3	4	That day	may it turn to darkness may God above not care about it may no light shine upon it. 
3	5	May darkness and deep shadow [Or and the shadow of death] claim it once more may a cloud settle over it may blackness overwhelm its light. 
3	6	That night	may thick darkness seize it may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months. 
3	7	May that night be barren may no shout of joy be heard in it.	
3	8	May those who curse days [Or the sea] curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan. 
3	9	May its morning stars become dark may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn, 
3	10	for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes. 
3	11	Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb? 
3	12	Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed? 
3	13	For now I would be lying down in peace I would be asleep and at rest 
3	14	with kings and counsellors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins, 
3	15	with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. 
3	16	Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day? 
3	17	There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest. 
3	18	Captives also enjoy their ease they no longer hear the slave driver’s shout. 
3	19	The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master. 
3	20	Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul, 
3	21	to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure, 
3	22	who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave? 
3	23	Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?	
3	24	For sighing comes to me instead of food my groans pour out like water. 
3	25	What I feared has come upon me what I dreaded has happened to me. 
3	26	I have no peace, no quietness I have no rest, but only turmoil.
