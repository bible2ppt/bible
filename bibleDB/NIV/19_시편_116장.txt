116	1	I love the LORD, for he heard my voice he heard my cry for mercy. 
116	2	Because he turned his ear to me, I will call on him as long as I live. 
116	3	The cords of death entangled me, the anguish of the grave [Hebrew	 Sheol] came upon me I was overcome by trouble and sorrow. 
116	4	Then I called on the name of the LORD	 O LORD, save me! 
116	5	The LORD is gracious and righteous our God is full of compassion. 
116	6	The LORD protects the simple-hearted when I was in great need, he saved me. 
116	7	Be at rest once more, O my soul, for the LORD has been good to you. 
116	8	For you, O LORD, have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling, 
116	9	that I may walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 
116	10	I believed therefore [Or believed even when] I said, I am greatly afflicted. 
116	11	And in my dismay I said, All men are liars. 
116	12	How can I repay the LORD for all his goodness to me? 
116	13	I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD. 
116	14	I will fulfil my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people. 
116	15	Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 
116	16	LORD, truly I am your servant I am your servant, the son of your maidservant [Or servant, your faithful son] you have freed me from my chains. 
116	17	I will sacrifice a thank-offering to you and call on the name of the LORD. 
116	18	I will fulfil my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people, 
116	19	in the courts of the house of the LORD	in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD. [Hebrew	 Hallelu Yah]
