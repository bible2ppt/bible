11	1	Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. 
11	2	I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, [Or traditions] just as I passed them on to you. 
11	3	Now I want you to realise that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 
11	4	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonours his head. 
11	5	And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonours her head	it is just as though her head were shaved. 
11	6	If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. 
11	7	A man ought not to cover his head, [Or 4 Every man who prays or prophesies with long hair dishonours his head. 5 And every woman who prays or prophesies with no covering of hair on her head dishonours her head	she is just like one of the shorn women. 6 
11	8	For man did not come from woman, but woman from man 
11	9	neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 
11	10	For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. 
11	11	In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 
11	12	For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. 
11	13	Judge for yourselves	 Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
11	14	Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 
11	15	but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. 
11	16	If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice	nor do the churches of God. 
11	17	In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. 
11	18	In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 
11	19	No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval. 
11	20	When you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat, 
11	21	for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. 
11	22	Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! 
11	23	For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you	 The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 
11	24	and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, This is my body, which is for you do this in remembrance of me. 
11	25	In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me. 
11	26	For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. 
11	27	Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 
11	28	A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. 
11	29	For anyone who eats and drinks without recognising the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. 
11	30	That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 
11	31	But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. 
11	32	When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. 
11	33	So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. 
11	34	If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.
