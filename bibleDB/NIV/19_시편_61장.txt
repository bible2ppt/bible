61	1	Hear my cry, O God listen to my prayer. 
61	2	From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 
61	3	For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe. 
61	4	I long to dwell in your tent for ever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah 
61	5	For you have heard my vows, O God you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. 
61	6	Increase the days of the king’s life, his years for many generations. 
61	7	May he be enthroned in God’s presence for ever appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him. 
61	8	Then will I ever sing praise to your name and fulfil my vows day after day. 131762 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. FOR JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF DAVID.
