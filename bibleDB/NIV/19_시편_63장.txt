63	1	O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you my soul thirsts for you, my body longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there is no water. 
63	2	I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory. 
63	3	Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you. 
63	4	I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands. 
63	5	My soul will be satisfied as with the richest of foods with singing lips my mouth will praise you. 
63	6	On my bed I remember you I think of you through the watches of the night. 
63	7	Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings. 
63	8	My soul clings to you your right hand upholds me. 
63	9	They who seek my life will be destroyed they will go down to the depths of the earth. 
63	10	They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals. 
63	11	But the king will rejoice in God all who swear by Godâ€™s name will praise him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.64 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. A PSALM OF DAVID.
