49	1	Hear this, all you peoples listen, all who live in this world, 
49	2	both low and high, rich and poor alike	 
49	3	My mouth will speak words of wisdom the utterance from my heart will give understanding. 
49	4	I will turn my ear to a proverb with the harp I will expound my riddle	 
49	5	Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me 
49	6	those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches? 
49	7	No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him 
49	8	the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough 
49	9	that he should live on for ever and not see decay. 
49	10	For all can see that wise men die the foolish and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others. 
49	11	Their tombs will remain their houses [Septuagint and Syriac Hebrew In their thoughts their houses will remain] for ever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had [Or for they have] named lands after themselves. 
49	12	But man, despite his riches, does not endure he is [Hebrew Septuagint and Syriac read verse 12 the same as verse 20.] like the beasts that perish. 
49	13	This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings. Selah 
49	14	Like sheep they are destined for the grave, [Hebrew	 Sheol also in verse 15] and death will feed on them. The upright will rule over them in the morning their forms will decay in the grave, [Hebrew	 Sheol also in verse 15] far from their princely mansi 
49	15	But God will redeem my life [Or soul] from the grave he will surely take me to himself. Selah 
49	16	Do not be overawed when a man grows rich, when the splendour of his house increases 
49	17	for he will take nothing with him when he dies, his splendour will not descend with him. 
49	18	Though while he lived he counted himself blessed	and men praise you when you prosper 
49	19	he will join the generation of his fathers, who will never see the light of life. 
49	20	A man who has riches without understanding is like the beasts that perish.50 A PSALM OF ASAPH.
