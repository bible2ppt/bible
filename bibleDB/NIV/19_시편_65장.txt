65	2	you who hear prayer, to you all men will come. 
65	3	When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave [Or made atonement for] our transgressions. 
65	4	Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple. 
65	5	You answer us with awesome deeds of righteousness, O God our Saviour, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas, 
65	6	who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength, 
65	7	who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations. 
65	8	Those living far away fear your wonders where morning dawns and evening fades you call forth songs of joy. 
65	9	You care for the land and water it you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with corn, for so you have ordained it. [Or for that is how you prepare the land] 
65	10	You drench its furrows and level its ridges you soften it with showers and bless its crops. 
65	11	You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.
