7	1	O LORD my God, I take refuge in you save and deliver me from all who pursue me, 
7	2	or they will tear me like a lion and rip me to pieces with noone to rescue me. 
7	3	LORD my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands 
7	4	if I have done evil to him who is at peace with me or without cause have robbed my foe 
7	5	then let my enemy pursue and overtake me let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust. Selah 
7	6	Arise, O LORD, in your anger rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God decree justice. 
7	7	Let the assembled peoples gather round you. Rule over them from on high 
7	8	let the LORD judge the peoples. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High. 
7	9	righteous God, who searches minds and hearts, bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure. 
7	10	My shield [Or sovereign] is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart. 
7	11	God is a righteous judge, a God who expresses his wrath every day. 
7	12	If he does not relent, he [Or If a man does not repent, God] will sharpen his sword he will bend and string his bow. 
7	13	He has prepared his deadly weapons he makes ready his flaming arrows. 
7	14	He who is pregnant with evil and conceives trouble gives birth to disillusionment. 
7	15	He who digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit he has made. 
7	16	The trouble he causes recoils on himself his violence comes down on his own head. 
7	17	I will give thanks to the LORD because of his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.8 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. ACCORDING TO GITTITH. [TITLE	 PROBABLY A MUSICAL TERM] A PSALM OF DAVID.
