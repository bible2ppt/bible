132	1	O LORD, remember David and all the hardships he endured. 
132	2	He swore an oath to the LORD and made a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob	 
132	3	I will not enter my house or go to my bed 
132	4	I will allow no sleep to my eyes, no slumber to my eyelids, 
132	5	till I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob. 
132	6	We heard it in Ephrathah, we came upon it in the fields of Jaar	 [That is, Kiriath Jearim] [Or heard of it in Ephrathah, we found it in the fields of Jaar. (and no quotation marks around verses 7-9)] 
132	7	Let us go to his dwelling-place let us worship at his footstool 
132	8	arise, O LORD, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. 
132	9	May your priests be clothed with righteousness may your saints sing for joy. 
132	10	For the sake of David your servant, do not reject your anointed one. 
132	11	The LORD swore an oath to David, a sure oath that he will not revoke	 One of your own descendants I will place on your throne 
132	12	if your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons shall sit on your throne for ever and ever. 
132	13	For the LORD has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling	 
132	14	This is my resting place for ever and ever here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it 
132	15	I will bless her with abundant provisions her poor will I satisfy with food. 
132	16	I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall ever sing for joy. 
132	17	Here I will make a horn [Horn here symbolises strong one, that is, king.] grow for David and set up a lamp for my anointed one. 
132	18	I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown on his head shall be resplendent.133 A SONG OF ASCENTS. OF DAVID.
