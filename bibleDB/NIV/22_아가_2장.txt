2	1	I am a rose [Possibly a member of the crocus family] of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. 
2	2	Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the maidens. 
2	3	Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my lover among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste. 
2	4	He has taken me to the banquet hall, and his banner over me is love. 
2	5	Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love. 
2	6	His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me. 
2	7	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field	 Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires. 
2	8	Listen! My lover! Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills. 
2	9	My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice. 
2	10	My lover spoke and said to me, Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come with me. 
2	11	See! The winter is past the rains are over and gone. 
2	12	Flowers appear on the earth the season of singing has come, the cooing of doves is heard in our land. 
2	13	The fig-tree forms its early fruit the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling my beautiful one, come with me. 
2	14	My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding-places on the mountainside, show me your face, let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. 
2	15	Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom. 
2	16	My lover is mine and I am his he browses among the lilies. 
2	17	Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn, my lover, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the rugged hills. [Or the hills of Bether]
