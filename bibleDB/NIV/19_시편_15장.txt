15	1	LORD, who may dwell in your sanctuary? Who may live on your holy hill? 
15	2	He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from his heart 
15	3	and has no slander on his tongue, who does his neighbour no wrong and casts no slur on his fellow-man, 
15	4	who despises a vile man but honours those who fear the LORD, who keeps his oath even when it hurts, 
15	5	who lends his money without usury and does not accept a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.16 A MIKTAM [TITLE	 PROBABLY A LITERARY OR MUSICAL TERM] OF DAVID.
