19	1	Then Job replied	 
19	2	How long will you torment me and crush me with words? 
19	3	Ten times now you have reproached me shamelessly you attack me. 
19	4	If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone. 
19	5	If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me, 
19	6	then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me. 
19	7	Though I cry, `I’ve been wronged!’ I get no response though I call for help, there is no justice. 
19	8	He has blocked my way so that I cannot pass he has shrouded my paths in darkness. 
19	9	He has stripped me of my honour and removed the crown from my head. 
19	10	He tears me down on every side till I am gone he uproots my hope like a tree. 
19	11	His anger burns against me he counts me among his enemies.	
19	12	His troops advance in force they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent. 
19	13	He has alienated my brothers from me my acquaintances are completely estranged from me. 
19	14	My kinsmen have gone away my friends have forgotten me. 
19	15	My guests and my maidservants count me a stranger they look upon me as an alien. 
19	16	I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth. 
19	17	My breath is offensive to my wife I am loathsome to my own brothers. 
19	18	Even the little boys scorn me when I appear, they ridicule me. 
19	19	All my intimate friends detest me those I love have turned against me. 
19	20	I am nothing but skin and bones I have escaped by only the skin of my teeth. [Or only my gums] 
19	21	Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me. 
19	22	Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh? 
19	23	Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll, 
19	24	that they were inscribed with an iron tool on [Or and] lead, or engraved in rock for ever! 
19	25	I know that my Redeemer [Or defender] lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth. [Or upon my grave] 
19	26	And after my skin has been destroyed, yet [Or And after I awake, though this body has been destroyed, then] in [Or apart from] my flesh I will see God	
19	27	I myself will see him with my own eyes	I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me! 
19	28	If you say, `How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him,’ [Many Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint and Vulgate most Hebrew manuscripts me] 
19	29	you should fear the sword yourselves for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment. [Or that you may come to know the Almighty]
