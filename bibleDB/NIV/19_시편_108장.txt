108	1	My heart is steadfast, O God I will sing and make music with all my soul. 
108	2	Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. 
108	3	I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations I will sing of you among the peoples. 
108	4	For great is your love, higher than the heavens your faithfulness reaches to the skies. 
108	5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let your glory be over all the earth. 
108	6	Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered. 
108	7	God has spoken from his sanctuary	 In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Succoth. 
108	8	Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my sceptre. 
108	9	Moab is my washbasin, upon Edom I toss my sandal over Philistia I shout in triumph. 
108	10	Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 
108	11	Is it not you, O God, you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies? 
108	12	Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless. 
108	13	With God we shall gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.109 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. OF DAVID. A PSALM.
