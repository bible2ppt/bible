2	1	From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God. 
2	2	He said	 In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From the depths of the grave [Hebrew Sheol] I called for help, and you listened to my cry. 
2	3	You hurled me into the deep, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me all your waves and breakers swept over me. 
2	4	I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight yet I will look again towards your holy temple.’ 
2	5	The engulfing waters threatened me, [Or waters were at my throat] the deep surrounded me seaweed was wrapped around my head. 
2	6	To the roots of the mountains I sank down the earth beneath barred me in for ever. But you brought my life up from the pit, O LORD my God. 
2	7	When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple. 
2	8	Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs. 
2	9	But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the LORD. 
2	10	And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
