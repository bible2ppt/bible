129	1	They have greatly oppressed me from my youth	let Israel say 
129	2	they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me. 
129	3	Ploughmen have ploughed my back and made their furrows long. 
129	4	But the LORD is righteous he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked. 
129	5	May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame. 
129	6	May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow 
129	7	with it the reaper cannot fill his hands, nor the one who gathers fill his arms. 
129	8	May those who pass by not say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you we bless you in the name of the LORD.130 A SONG OF ASCENTS.
