83	1	O God, do not keep silent be not quiet, O God, be not still. 
83	2	See how your enemies are astir, how your foes rear their heads. 
83	3	With cunning they conspire against your people they plot against those you cherish. 
83	4	Come, they say, let us destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel be remembered no more. 
83	5	With one mind they plot together they form an alliance against you 
83	6	the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites, 
83	7	Gebal, [That is, Byblos] Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre. 
83	8	Even Assyria has joined them to lend strength to the descendants of Lot. Selah 
83	9	Do to them as you did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon, 
83	10	who perished at Endor and became like refuse on the ground. 
83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, 
83	12	who said, Let us take possession of the pasture-lands of God. 
83	13	Make them like tumble-weed, O my God, like chaff before the wind. 
83	14	As fire consumes the forest or a flame sets the mountains ablaze, 
83	15	so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm. 
83	16	Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your name, O LORD. 
83	17	May they ever be ashamed and dismayed may they perish in disgrace. 
83	18	Let them know that you, whose name is the LORD	that you alone are the Most High over all the earth.84 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. ACCORDING TO GITTITH. [TITLE	 PROBABLY A MUSICAL TERM] OF THE SONS OF KORAH. A PSALM.
