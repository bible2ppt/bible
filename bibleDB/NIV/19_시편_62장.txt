62	1	My soul finds rest in God alone my salvation comes from him. 
62	2	He alone is my rock and my salvation he is my fortress, I shall never be shaken. 
62	3	How long will you assault a man? Would all of you throw him down	this leaning wall, this tottering fence? 
62	4	They fully intend to topple him from his lofty place they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse. Selah 
62	5	Find rest, O my soul, in God alone my hope comes from him. 
62	6	He alone is my rock and my salvation he is my fortress, I shall not be shaken. 
62	7	My salvation and my honour depend on God [Or God Most High is my salvation and my honour] he is my mighty rock, my refuge. 
62	8	Trust in him at all times, O people pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge. Selah 
62	9	Lowborn men are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie if weighed on a balance, they are nothing together they are only a breath. 
62	10	Do not trust in extortion or take pride in stolen goods though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them. 
62	11	One thing God has spoken, two things have I heard	 that you, O God, are strong, 
62	12	and that you, O Lord, are loving. Surely you will reward each person according to what he has done. 131863 A PSALM OF DAVID. WHEN HE WAS IN THE DESERT OF JUDAH.
