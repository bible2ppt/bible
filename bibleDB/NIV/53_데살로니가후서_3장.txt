3	1	Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honoured, just as it was with you. 
3	2	And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith. 
3	3	But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one. 
3	4	We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command. 
3	5	May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance. 
3	6	In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching [Or tradition] you received from us. 
3	7	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you, 
3	8	nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, labouring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you. 
3	9	We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves a model for you to follow. 
3	10	For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule	 If a man will not work, he shall not eat. 
3	11	We hear that some among you are idle. They are not busy they are busybodies. 
3	12	Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat. 
3	13	And as for you, brothers, never tire of doing what is right. 
3	14	If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of him. Do not associate with him, in order that he may feel ashamed. 
3	15	Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother. 
3	16	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you. 
3	17	I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write. 
3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. 535 1 TIMOTHY
