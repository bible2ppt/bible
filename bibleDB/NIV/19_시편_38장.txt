38	1	O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath. 
38	2	For your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down upon me. 
38	3	Because of your wrath there is no health in my body my bones have no soundness because of my sin. 
38	4	My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. 
38	5	My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly. 
38	6	I am bowed down and brought very low all day long I go about mourning. 
38	7	My back is filled with searing pain there is no health in my body. 
38	8	I am feeble and utterly crushed I groan in anguish of heart. 
38	9	All my longings lie open before you, O Lord	 my sighing is not hidden from you. 
38	10	My heart pounds, my strength fails me even the light has gone from my eyes. 
38	11	My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds my neighbours stay far away. 
38	12	Those who seek my life set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin all day long they plot deception. 
38	13	I am like a deaf man, who cannot hear, like a mute, who cannot open his mouth 
38	14	I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply. 
38	15	I wait for you, O LORD you will answer, O Lord my God. 
38	16	For I said, Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips. 
38	17	For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me. 
38	18	I confess my iniquity I am troubled by my sin. 
38	19	Many are those who are my vigorous enemies those who hate me without reason are numerous. 
38	20	Those who repay my good with evil slander me when I pursue what is good. 
38	21	LORD, do not forsake me be not far from me, O my God. 
38	22	Come quickly to help me, O Lord my Saviour.39 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. FOR JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF DAVID.
