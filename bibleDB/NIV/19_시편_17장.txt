17	1	Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer	it does not rise from deceitful lips. 
17	2	May my vindication come from you may your eyes see what is right. 
17	3	Though you probe my heart and examine me at night, though you test me, you will find nothing I have resolved that my mouth will not sin. 
17	4	As for the deeds of men	by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent. 
17	5	My steps have held to your paths my feet have not slipped. 
17	6	I call on you, O God, for you will answer me give ear to me and hear my prayer. 
17	7	Show the wonder of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes. 
17	8	Keep me as the apple of your eye hide me in the shadow of your wings 
17	9	from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me. 
17	10	They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with arrogance. 
17	11	They have tracked me down, they now surround me, with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground. 
17	12	They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a great lion crouching in cover. 
17	13	Rise up, O LORD, confront them, bring them down rescue me from the wicked by your sword. 
17	14	LORD, by your hand save me from such men, from men of this world whose reward is in this life. You still the hunger of those you cherish their sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children. 
17	15	And I	in righteousness I shall see your face when I awake, I shall be satisfied with seeing your likeness.18 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. OF DAVID THE SERVANT OF THE LORD. HE SANG TO THE LORD THE WORDS OF THIS SONG WHEN THE LORD DELIVERED HIM FROM THE H
