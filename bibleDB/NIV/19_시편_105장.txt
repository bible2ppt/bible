105	1	Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name make known among the nations what he has done. 
105	2	Sing to him, sing praise to him tell of all his wonderful acts. 
105	3	Glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. 
105	4	Look to the LORD and his strength seek his face always. 
105	5	Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced, 
105	6	descendants of Abraham his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones. 
105	7	He is the LORD our God his judgments are in all the earth. 
105	8	He remembers his covenant for ever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations, 
105	9	the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac. 
105	10	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant	 
105	11	To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit. 
105	12	When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it, 
105	13	they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another. 
105	14	He allowed no-one to oppress them for their sake he rebuked kings	 
105	15	Do not touch my anointed ones do my prophets no harm. 
105	16	He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food 
105	17	and he sent a man before them	Joseph, sold as a slave. 
105	18	They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons, 
105	19	till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true. 
105	20	The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free. 
105	21	He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed, 
105	22	to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom. 
105	23	Then Israel entered Egypt Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham. 
105	24	The LORD made his people very fruitful he made them too numerous for their foes, 
105	25	whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants. 
105	26	He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. 
105	27	They performed his miraculous signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham. 
105	28	He sent darkness and made the land dark	for had they not rebelled against his words? 
105	29	He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die. 
105	30	Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers. 
105	31	He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country. 
105	32	He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land 
105	33	he struck down their vines and fig-trees and shattered the trees of their country. 
105	34	He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number 
105	35	they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil. 
105	36	Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood. 
105	37	He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no-one faltered. 
105	38	Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them. 
105	39	He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night. 
105	40	They asked, and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 
105	41	He opened the rock, and water gushed out like a river it flowed in the desert. 
105	42	For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham. 
105	43	He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy 
105	44	he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for 
105	45	that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws. Praise the LORD. [Hebrew	 Hallelu Yah]
