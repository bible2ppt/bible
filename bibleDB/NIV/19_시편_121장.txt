121	1	I lift up my eyes to the hills	where does my help come from? 
121	2	My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. 
121	3	He will not let your foot slip	he who watches over you will not slumber 
121	4	indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 
121	5	The LORD watches over you	the LORD is your shade at your right hand 
121	6	the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. 
121	7	The LORD will keep you from all harm	he will watch over your life 
121	8	the LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and for evermore. 1408122 A SONG OF ASCENTS. OF DAVID.
