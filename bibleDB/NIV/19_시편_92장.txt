92	1	It is good to praise the LORD and make music to your name, O Most High, 
92	2	to proclaim your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night, 
92	3	to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp. 
92	4	For you make me glad by your deeds, O LORD I sing for joy at the work of your hands. 
92	5	How great are your works, O LORD, how profound your thoughts! 
92	6	The senseless man does not know, fools do not understand, 
92	7	that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be for ever destroyed. 
92	8	But you, O LORD, are exalted for ever. 
92	9	For surely your enemies, O LORD, surely your enemies will perish all evildoers will be scattered. 
92	10	You have exalted my horn [Horn here symbolises strength.] like that of a wild ox fine oils have been poured upon me. 
92	11	My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes. 
92	12	The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon 
92	13	planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God. 
92	14	They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green, 
92	15	proclaiming, The LORD is upright he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.
