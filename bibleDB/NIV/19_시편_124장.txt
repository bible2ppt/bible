124	1	If the LORD had not been on our side	let Israel say 
124	2	if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us, 
124	3	when their anger flared against us, they would have swallowed us alive 
124	4	the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us, 
124	5	the raging waters would have swept us away. 
124	6	Praise be to the LORD, who has not let us be torn by their teeth. 
124	7	We have escaped like a bird out of the fowlerâ€™s snare the snare has been broken, and we have escaped. 
124	8	Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.125 A SONG OF ASCENTS.
