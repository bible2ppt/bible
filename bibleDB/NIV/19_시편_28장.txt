28	1	To you I call, O LORD my Rock do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent, I shall be like those who have gone down to the pit. 
28	2	Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands towards your Most Holy Place. 
28	3	Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbours but harbour malice in their hearts. 
28	4	Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work repay them for what their hands have done and bring back upon them what they deserve. 
28	5	Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again. 
28	6	Praise be to the LORD, for he has heard my cry for mercy. 
28	7	The LORD is my strength and my shield my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song. 
28	8	The LORD is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one. 
28	9	Save your people and bless your inheritance be their shepherd and carry them for ever.29 A PSALM OF DAVID.
