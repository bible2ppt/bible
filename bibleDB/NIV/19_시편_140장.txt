140	1	Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men protect me from men of violence, 
140	2	who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day. 
140	3	They make their tongues as sharp as a serpentâ€™s the poison of vipers is on their lips. Selah 
140	4	Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked protect me from men of violence who plan to trip my feet. 
140	5	Proud men have hidden a snare for me they have spread out the cords of their net and have set traps for me along my path. Selah 
140	6	LORD, I say to you, You are my God. Hear, O LORD, my cry for mercy. 
140	7	Sovereign LORD, my strong deliverer, who shields my head in the day of battle 
140	8	do not grant the wicked their desires, O LORD do not let their plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah 
140	9	Let the heads of those who surround me be covered with the trouble their lips have caused. 
140	10	Let burning coals fall upon them may they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, never to rise. 
140	11	Let slanderers not be established in the land may disaster hunt down men of violence. 
140	12	I know that the LORD secures justice for the poor and upholds the cause of the needy. 
140	13	Surely the righteous will praise your name and the upright will live before you.141 A PSALM OF DAVID.
