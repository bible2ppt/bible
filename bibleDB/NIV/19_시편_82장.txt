82	1	God presides in the great assembly he gives judgment among the gods	 
82	2	How long will you [The Hebrew is plural.] defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked? Selah 
82	3	Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed. 
82	4	Rescue the weak and needy deliver them from the hand of the wicked. 
82	5	They know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 
82	6	I said, `You are gods you are all sons of the Most High.â€™ 
82	7	But you will die like mere men you will fall like every other ruler. 
82	8	Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are your inheritance.83 A SONG. A PSALM OF ASAPH.
