19	1	The heavens declare the glory of God the skies proclaim the work of his hands. 
19	2	Day after day they pour forth speech night after night they display knowledge. 
19	3	There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. [Or They have no speech, there are no words no sound is heard from them] 
19	4	Their voice [Septuagint, Jerome and Syriac Hebrew line] goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun, 
19	5	which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. 
19	6	It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other nothing is hidden from its heat. 
19	7	The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple. 
19	8	The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes. 
19	9	The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring for ever. The ordinances of the LORD are sure and altogether righteous. 
19	10	They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb. 
19	11	By them is your servant warned in keeping them there is great reward. 
19	12	Who can discern his errors? Forgive my hidden faults. 
19	13	Keep your servant also from wilful sins may they not rule over me. Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression. 
19	14	May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.20 FOR THE DIRECTOR OF MUSIC. A PSALM OF DAVID.
