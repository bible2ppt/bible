40	1	In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city	on that very day the hand of the LORD was upon me and he took me there. 
40	2	In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city. 
40	3	He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. 
40	4	The man said to me, Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the house of Israel everything you see. 
40	5	I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring rod in the manâ€™s hand was six long 1892 cubits, each of which was a cubit [The common cubit was about 1 1/2 feet (about 0.5 metre).] and a handbreadth. [That is, about 3 in

40	12	In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square. 
40	13	Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the opposite one the distance was twenty-five cubits from one parapet opening to the opposite one.

40	16	The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all round, as was the portico the openings all round faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees. 
40	17	Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all round the court there were thirty rooms along the pavement. 
40	18	It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long this was the lower pavement. 
40	19	Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court it was a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north.

40	22	Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them. 
40	23	There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one it was a hundred cubits. 
40	24	Then he led me to the south side and I saw a gate facing south. He measured its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others. 
40	25	The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all round, like the openings of the others. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 
40	26	Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them it had palm tree decorations on the faces of the projecting walls on each side. 
40	27	The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side it was a hundred cubits.

40	37	Its portico [Septuagint (see also verses 31 and 34) Hebrew jambs] faced the outer court palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it. 
40	38	A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed. 
40	39	In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings and guilt offerings were slaughtered. 
40	40	By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the entrance to the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two tables.
