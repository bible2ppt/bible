130	1	Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD 
130	2	Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy. 
130	3	If you, O LORD, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? 
130	4	But with you there is forgiveness therefore you are feared. 
130	5	I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his word I put my hope. 
130	6	My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning. 
130	7	Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is unfailing love and with him is full redemption. 
130	8	He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins. 1413131 A SONG OF ASCENTS. OF DAVID.
